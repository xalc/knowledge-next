## Project experience

### Unreal Data

This is an internal IBM hyper blue project, mainly focus on synthesize data using the reinforce learning algorithm. To obey the GDPR requirement, our client can not share the real data to other so they need generate the ‘unreal’ data similar to ‘real‘ data for further usage. 

This project has three part contains core algorithm, user interface development(Website), and API  connector.

My role is manage and develop the website.  we normally have 5 engineers working on it. for the management: I create the issues to backlog and trace them in the dashboard, assign the issue to the proper person and  estimate the time and priority, join the meeting to get the feedback and new requirement from upside. for the development, I build the website architecture, making decision  for tools and technics and develop core features.

The main deliverable product is a deployed website, end use can config their data rules and view the synthesized data with the modern visualization technologies.

The IBM SPSS Statistics is a well known software for mathematic and statistics. 

To adapt the development of modernization, the higher decision team determine to develop a new product with the fashion user experience using the cross platform web technologies. 

The objective of this project is to refresh the old out dated UI and delivery a new fashion UI with  modern user friendly elements and enhance the revenue.

The software contains data editor, syntax editor and output viewer. 

Our team is focus on output viewer, we get the output data from the backend team then structure them and show them on the canvas. 

For my role, I am writing code to implement the requirement such as show the complex tables, charts and other structures, also I am responsible the performance of the output handle the exception cases. I am compare the load /render time of the output viewer to find out the bottleneck and assign the performance fixes issue to teammates them review these fixes.finally we have fired some patent about our way of performance improvement.

the whole project is using hybrid developing approach while for output viewer team is an agile team. we have daily standup meeting and spring planning review meeting. each month we have retrospective meeting to summarize what we did good, which can do better.
